## Problems
System calls are expensive
* computer saves its state

* os examines call parameters
* os performs the requested function
* os saves its state
* os returns control of the cpu to caller  

## Categories

3. Device Manipulation - request/release device
4. Information Maintenance
5. Communications - create/delete connections

## System calls vs library calls
Each I/O system call has corresponding procedure calls from standard I/O library

## Usage
* Manage file system
* control processes

## OS Design Issues
* Structure
* Sharing
* Naming
* Protection
* Security
* Preformance
* Reliability
* Extensibility
* Communication
* Concurrency
